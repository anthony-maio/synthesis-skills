# Repo Surveyor

## Overview

Use this skill only when Cartograph itself is unavailable or when you need to manually verify its outputs.

## Workflow

Manual workflow:
1. Discover source, config, and entry files. Skip generated, vendored, and build output.
2. Rank likely-important files by entry points, fan-in, API surface, and root wiring role.
3. Trace the strongest dependency hubs instead of reading the whole tree.
4. Build the smallest useful file set for the current task.
5. Produce a doc-ready summary from that reduced set.

## Output Contract

Output contract:
- Key files
- Dependency hubs
- Minimal task context
- Doc-ready summary

## Rules

Rules:
- Prefer `use-cartograph` whenever the tool becomes available.
- Keep manual reads narrow.
- Match the same output shape as `use-cartograph`.
